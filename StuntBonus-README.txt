SA-MP Custom Stunt Bonuses by NaS (c) 2016

This is a small Filterscript for SAMP which introduces Stunt Bonuses (Jumps only, no 2-wheel/wheelie Stunts) to the Multiplayer World.
Those are natively existing (EnableStuntBonusForPlayer/All), however they only work on the original map and are highly abusive if there are custom objects.
Also the Server cannot know if the player is using a moneyhack or actually stunting.

Using ColAndreas, Jumps can also be detected on custom objects!
This gives you full control over the Stunts. You can create custom rewards like Stunt Points or only show the Stunt Message without any rewards. Be creative!

Until now, the Script is able to detect the Jump's duration, distance, Saltos, Barrel Rolls and 360 Turns, and also features Stunt-Combos.
In the future I plan to also add Plane Stunts (Loops, Barrel Rolls etc) but with a little more challenge to it (maybe different combos of stunts give rewards?).

Config defines and most of the functions are explained inside the script.


To run this script, you need the foreach include, the ColAndreas Plugin and the QuaternionStuff Plugin.

Also thanks to ProRakNet, he reminded me of this again. Almost abandoned it.
